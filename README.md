# P2:CE Reloaded 
Mod based on Portal 2: Community Edition.
This is a fan port! I am not the creator of Portal Reloaded. Real developer sites: [portalreloaded.com](https://portalreloaded.com/) and [Portal Reloaded Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255980/Portal_Reloaded/)

## 
Most maps work (COOP does not work, that's why it was cut out). I have not tested the port for full playability. The only bug I noticed: the music doesn't work.
I don't know why this is happening.
bik files have been converted to webm format. Unfortunately, with loss of quality

## Launching (Steam)
For the mod to work, you must install [Portal 2: Community Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440000/Portal_2_Community_Edition/) and [Portal Reloaded](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255980/Portal_Reloaded/).
Mods can be launched from Steam if placed in the `steamapps/sourcemods/` folder. Note that you must quit and relaunch Steam for your mod to show up when you first create it.
