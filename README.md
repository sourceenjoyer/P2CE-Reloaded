# P2:CE Reloaded 
Mod based on Portal 2: Community Edition.
This is a fan port! I am not the creator of Portal Reloaded. Real developer sites: https://portalreloaded.com/ and https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255980/Portal_Reloaded/

## 
Most maps work (COOP does not work, that's why it was cut out). I have not tested the port for full playability. The only bug I noticed: the music doesn't work.
I don't know why this is happening.

## Launching (Steam)
Mods can be launched from Steam if placed in the `steamapps/sourcemods/` folder. Note that you must quit and relaunch Steam for your mod to show up when you first create it. 
To work, you must have and install P2:CE
